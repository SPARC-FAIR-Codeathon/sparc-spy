**Study Purpose:** The goal of this work is to create annotated generic pig heart scaffolds for 
registration of segmented data obtained by experimental groups.

**Data Collection:** The generic scaffold is created based on the general description
and average dimensions of pig hearts as in the literature data.

**Primary Conclusion:** None stated

---
**Curatorâ€™s Notes**

**Experimental Design:** Not applicable. 

**Completeness:** The study is ongoing and potentially will link to other datasets where the data is used for mapping onto the scaffold.

**Subjects & Samples:** The generic scaffold is not subject/sample specific but represents a generic pig heart.

**Primary vs derivative data:** The primary folder contains the mapping tool provenance data file needed to produce the generic pig heart scaffold. The mapping tool will be accessible from the release download page on the SPARC Portal. The derivative folder contains JSON files which are used to generate a visualization of the scaffold on the web portal.
