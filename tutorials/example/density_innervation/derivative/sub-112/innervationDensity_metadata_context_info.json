  "description": "Axon innervation data digitally traced from a flat-mount sample retrieved from the ventral stomach of subject 112 is used to compute a smooth innervation density distribution field. The data is mapped onto a common coordinate framework provided by the generic rat stomach scaffold. The colored lines represent the axon innervation while the white-to-blue spectrum represents the spatial distribution of innervation density, with blue representing areas with dense innervation and white areas are sparse in innervation.
